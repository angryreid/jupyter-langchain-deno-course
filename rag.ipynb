    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a model that combines the strengths of retrieval and generation models. It uses a retriever to find relevant passages and a generator to generate the answer. The retriever is a dense retriever that uses a pre-trained language model to encode the passages and the query. The generator is a pre-trained language model that generates the answer. The retriever and the generator are trained jointly."
